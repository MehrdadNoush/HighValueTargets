# HighValueTargets
Defining High Value Targets in cybersecurity, grouping them and mapping incidents / stories for Risk Awareness material / content

Individuals in certain roles or positions may be at an elevated risk of cyber-attacks. They may be targeted using specific methods of hacking or threat vectors tailored to their roles or positions that differ from the most common attacks. These individuals are often considered "High Value Targets" (HVTs) and may require additional protection and security measures.

The aim of this repo is to utilise incident summaries to deliver more content to enhance risk awareness training/material that is more relevant for HVT's.

We aim to do this by defining HVT's, providing type of HVT's and potentially group them. Subsequently to archive various incidents mapped to those groups which can be then used to create risk awareness training material. 

This is at draft stage, awaiting formal review of my thesis (awaiting formal publication, will share link one done) and hoping to expand further over time. 

Thanks for reading.
